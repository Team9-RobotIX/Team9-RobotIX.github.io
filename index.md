FloBot is an automated delivery system made for use in hospitals but extensible to other scenarios. It uses an overhead camera to detect the relative locations of delivery robots and direct them to the appropriate delivery locations.

One of our main goals when making robot was to ensure that chain of custody was preserved when delivering. We thus designed a secure, IP65 compliant, magnetically-locked enclosure that ensures that samples and/or documents are safely delivered, without compromising on their integrity or security.

Note that FloBot is a prototype, and not currently production ready. Interested in seeing FloBot in your local hospital? [Feel free to contact us](sdp-t09@inf.ed.ac.uk).

### How does it work?

FloBot works by using a technique called _magic_. It's very complicated.

### Why did you call it FloBot?

Because of [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale). She's awesome.
